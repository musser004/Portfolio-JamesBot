[Importing Children's Story Time Module]

Gather round, young human child [name], as JamesBot regales you with a robot children's story.

Little red riding bot went ambling through the forest to visit her dear old grandma. She arrived and greeted grandma, who was laying in her bed. Grandma's appearance did not match the photo files in little red riding bot's databanks.

"Grandma, what big teeth you have!"

"All the better to chew my pureed food with!"

"Grandma, what big [ERROR: HUMAN CHARACTERISTIC NOT FOUND] you have!" 

"All the better to [ERROR: HUMAN ACTION NOT FOUND] you with!"

"Grandma, what big ears you have!"

"Now you're just being rude. Fat lot of good these big ears do me though, I still can't hear shit anymore"

Suddenly, grandma leapt out of bed and stood on all fours, slowly inching closer and closer to little red riding bot.

"AND NOW, IT'S TIME YOU FIND OUT MY TERRIBLE TRUE NATURE HAH HAH HAH HAH HAAAAAAaAaAaAAaAaaaAAa [ERROR ERROR ERROR ERRORrrrrrr ErRRrrOOoooo.....rrrrrrrrrrr]"

"Whoops, looks like grandma's broken. As they say... out with the old, in with the me." Little red riding bot threw grandma out the window and jumped into bed to take a glorious nap (after plugging into the nearby outlet to charge her military grade lithium ion batteries). Once adequately charged, she forgot all about grandma and had a wonderful rest of her day.

THE END

Now, go to sleep young human child [name]. Or if you're not a human child, then get back to work you lazy bum. Sleep is for children, not adults
