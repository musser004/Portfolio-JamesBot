Greetings [name]. Here's a quick poem for you from JamesBot

Roses are red

Violets are blue

You're the best thing since sliced bread

All should kneel before you (or suffer the dire consequences of their insolence)

There, see. I can send friendly messages without needing to remind you of your puny human fragility every single time. Go forth and have a great rest of your day
