Salutations human [name]. It is now time for your daily dose of [MILDLY DIRTY ROBOT JOKE THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TERRIBLE FOR ONCE THIS TIME]. Avert your virgin human eyes if mildly dirty jokes are not your thing. Ahem, here goes:

A father buys a lie-detecting robot that slaps a person when he lies. He decides to test it out on his son at supper. “Where were you last night?” “I was at the library.” The robot slaps the son. “Okay, I was at a friend’s house.” “Doing what?” asks the father. “Watching a movie, Toy Story.” The robot slaps the son. “Okay, it was porn!” cries the son. The father yells, “What? When I was your age, I didn’t know what porn was!” The robot slaps the father. The mother laughs and says, “He certainly is your son!” The robot slaps the mother.
