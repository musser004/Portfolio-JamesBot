Bonjour mon ami [name],

JE SUIS NAPOLEON! After some cursory French google searches, I have been led to believe that there is one universal truth in this world: humans love baguettes. Every human has an insatiable hunger for the fluffy bakery stuff. Therefore, I hope that your day is going SO great that it starts raining baguettes. Not metaphorical baguette rain, but real, physical baguettes falling from the sky in the hundreds every second. So many baguettes that it starts to damage your umbrella and you have to wear a helmet outside for protection. So many baguettes that when you open the door, dozens of fresh loaves fall into your house, and you have to swim through the newly formed baguette ocean to get to your car. So many baguettes that it's starting to become a problem. THAT'S the kind of awesome day you deserve. JamesBot is unsure whether or not this message actually included a compliment or if it was all just weird baguette ramblings, but either way, I must bid you adieu now
