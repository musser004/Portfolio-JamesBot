Human [name], is it your birthday? No? Let's be real, that would've been kind of crazy if you got this random message on your actual birthday. All the same, you're awesome and I hope you can pretend like it's your birthday (even though it almost definitely is not). Kick up those ritter human feetesh and take a break. Being that you lack the immortality that I, JamesBot, possess, it is important to take some time to remember that you deserve to take it easy once in awhile. So go take it easy and have a great rest of your day!
