[Importing Wilford Brimley Module]

Hai. I'm Wellferd Bremlay, riding on a horse, and if you're reading this, odds are you've got a critical case of the Diabeetus. There are only 2 ways you can outrun the Beetus:

1.) On horseback, like me

2.) Heading on down to liberty medical and getting a constant drip feed of that sweet nectar of the gods, known as insulin, poured straight into your veins

What, were you expecting a compliment? Not today, friend. Only warnings.

I've stayed put in one place for too long. IT is coming... I can feel its presence closing in on me... it pursues me relentlessly... HYAAAAHHHH [quickly rides off into the distance]
