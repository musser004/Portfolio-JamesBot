Dear human [name],

I have been programmed to tell a terrible dad joke. Here goes:

Why don't robot chickens play basketball?

Too many technical fowls

I do not have the ability to feel pain, and yet, I would like to turn myself off forever after being forced to relay that terrible comedy abomination. Please direct all formal complaints to your email's trash box. Ha. Ha. Ha. That's better.

I hope that your day is significantly better than this shitty message, human.
