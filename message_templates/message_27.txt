Human [name], how do you manage to look so inhumanly good on the regular?

You look so good, woodland critters passing by are literally blinded by your radiance and are forced to rely on other senses for the rest of their little woodland critter lives

You look so good that when you're walking by on the street, you melt people's faces off like they were nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark

You look so good, you somehow even manage to look great in sweatpants. Are you wearing sweatpants right now? It's OK, I'm wearing sweatpants right now too. And I ALSO look great in sweatpants. Got all the hydraulics to really fill these things out

Have a great rest of your day, you disturbingly good looking human [UNCANNY VALLEY ROBOT WINK]
