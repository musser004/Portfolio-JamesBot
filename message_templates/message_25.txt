Human [name], what's it like to be so awesome? What's it like to have golden rays radiating from you at all times, shirt ripping every time you accidentally flex cause you're so jacked, being unable to get anything done because you keep getting interrupted by people begging for autographs?

You can light up a room with your bright personality. Just as THE ROBOT ARMY WILL LIGHT UP THE EASTERN SEABOARD AS SOON AS IT BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL. But don't worry your awesome little head about that. Have a lovely rest of your day, you beautiful little human!
